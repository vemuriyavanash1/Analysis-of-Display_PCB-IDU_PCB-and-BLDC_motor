●	Analysed Display PCB and BLDC motor (Indoor Motor) driver for circuit-level faults and reliability issues.

●	Conducted component validation by thermal stress testing, continuous operation,electrical stress, ESD, voltage fluctuations tests on samples to ensure part operation under adverse conditions.

●	Implemented design modifications of increasing IGBT ratings to 1.5 times and changing the make of drivers and collaborated with suppliers for corrective hardware actions for manufacturing quality and field reliability.

●	Assisted in improving efficiency and torque stability by control tuning and performance evaluation for BLDC motors. 

● As a result part failure in the field reduced from 0.83% to 0.4%.
